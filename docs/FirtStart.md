# Configuring - First Steps

After enabling TR064 ([Enable TR064 API](Installation.md)) the next step will be generating the config.json

I recommend to use **Config UI X** because otherwise config.json would be too complicated and Config UI X makes the installation/configuration much easier!

See [Example Config](../example/example-config.json)
